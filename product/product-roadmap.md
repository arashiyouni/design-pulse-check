# Product Roadmap

## Sections

### 1. Landing Page
Public-facing page explaining Pulse Check's mission, the 4-pillar model, and how transparency-over-surveillance works.

### 2. Engineer Scorecard
The core experience: Composite Pulse Score with 4 pillar breakdowns, sparkline trends, period comparison, and full transparency view for individual engineers.

### 3. Data Ingestion & Signals
Automated delivery metrics (GitHub/Jira via daily cron), client pulse surveys (bi-weekly NPS/CSAT), lead check-ins (Growing/Stable/Blocked), and self-assessments with evidence URLs.

### 4. Needs Attention & Actions
Alert system with single-metric thresholds and combined-signal risk patterns, plus 1:1 action items tied to scorecard signals and historical timeline.

### 5. Portfolio View
Leadership dashboard showing the entire engineering roster sorted by attention signals, with mini-sparklines, trend filters, and drill-down into individual scorecards.

### 6. Project Settings
Project creation and management hub where partners/PMs create projects, assign them to client organizations, manage team assignments, and connect external integrations (GitHub, Jira, Linear) for automated delivery metric tracking.
